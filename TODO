parse_expr() in parse_type/decl
get rid of __asm__ hacks (mainly in gen_asm.c)

cpp2:
	fix dir-relative file opening

cc1:
	&x[y]

	typedefs and struct decls need to be scoped

	const:
		const char *s; - *s is not writable, s is

		const char *a = "hi";
		int x(char *s);
		x(a); // warning - removing const
		// same for assignments


cpp:
	cc -E dir/x.c
	doesn't work, but
	cd dir; cc -E x.c
	does

	cc -MM *.c

	push current_line when descending into #include


cc:
	eventually cc1.c with stabs/dwarf

	options:
		warn on "{ 1, 2, 3, }" - final comma
		warn on ?:


Features
--------

structs

long and short

cc accepts multiple input source files

link function prototypes with the function instance + arg check

32-bit code gen

general lhs assignment:
	(b ? x : y) = 5;
	^-- note: gnu extension
	(x ? a : b)(2); // similarly
	(x = y) = 2; // assign to x

assembly optimisation - remove asm_temp()

({ expr; })
parsing + gen

__attribute__((pure))
- function with no side effects (e.g. strlen())
