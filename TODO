cc1:
	fix "1 - 2 + 3"

	const:
		const char *s; - *s is not writable, s is

		const char *a = "hi";
		int x(char *s);
		x(a); // warning - removing const
		// same for assignments


cpp:
	cc -E dir/x.c
	doesn't work, but
	cd dir; cc -E x.c
	does

	cc -MM *.c


cc:
	-W code in cc.c
	-g in cc.c and eventually cc1.c with stabs/dwarf
	-I

	options:
		warn on "{ 1, 2, 3, }" - final comma
		warn on ?:


Features
--------

typedefs

structs

cc accepts multiple input source files

32-bit code gen

general lhs assignment:
	(b ? x : y) = 5;
	^-- note: gnu extension
	(x ? a : b)(2); // similarly
	(x = y) = 2; // assign to x

assembly optimisation - remove asm_temp()

({ expr; })
parsing + gen

for(...){
}else{
	printf("for not entered");
}
