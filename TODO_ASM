matching constraints
named constraints
operand modifiers (and opcode suffixes - see __asm/operand_modifier.c)

tying an input to an early-clobber output
	e.g.

	int x;
	__asm__("" : "&r"(x) : "0"(3));

	- no other input may share the same register as the input tied to the early-clobber
	- the tied output must have a register constraint, not memory (or any other)
	- only a single input may be tied to an output.
